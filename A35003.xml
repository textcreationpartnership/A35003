         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WE are met upon the moſt weighty Affair that can be to every one of us, even to wait that we may have a true knowledge of the beginning, carrying on and perfecting the mighty Work of Redemption, that People may know that Redemption is wrought in their Souls; for every ones Soul hath been loſt and captivated, and led away from the pure Preſence of God; all have been alienated by reaſon of Sin; which hath become an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Wall of Partition, and hath excluded and ſhut out unholy Souls from the Holy God; all that have been defiled and polluted they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42790:4"/> have been excluded from his Dwelling-place, they have been driven out into the World, and the World hath become a World of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and of Diſtraction and Confuſion, to the Sons and Daughters of Men; there hath been <hi>Anguiſh, Tribulation and Wrath</hi> upon all their Souls, and an inſenſibility hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto many that they have not been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the great Depravation they have lain under, and they have not been ſenſible of the Glory of that State and Condition which they were to have enjoyed, and in that State of Inſenſibility they have not ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord, but have been <hi>captivated and led away by divers Luſts and Pleaſures,</hi> by which they have wounded their own Souls more and more.</p>
            <p>And in ſuch a State as this, it is that the Lord hath found us, he hath ſought us out, and he hath found us, <hi>caſt out into the open Field, and wallowing as it were in our Blood,</hi> and yet this hath been a <hi>time of Love,</hi> and he hath manifeſted his Love to us in this reſpect in that he hath awakened us and brought us to a ſenſe of our depraved and deplorable Condition; and given unto a Remnant to perceive, that there is a <hi>more excellent Glory,</hi> a more excellent Enjoyment to be had, than any this World can afford.</p>
            <p>But a great many of thoſe whoſe Eyes are ſo far opened, that they can ſee and diſcern a more excellent Glory; yet they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, for they are not in a capacity for

Hereupon Deſires are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, by the divine Word of Life in the Sons and Daughters of Men through the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Mediator; by him Deſires are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in People that they might come to enjoy that Life of Holineſs, that they might not only ſee a better State than what they do enjoy, but that they might come to enjoy it and have i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, <hi>It is not of us ſo much as to think a good Thought.</hi> But this all People will grant is a good Thought, when a Sinner thinks of turning to God and leaving his evil Ways, if he had Power and Ability, and cries out, If I knew how to ſtand againſt Tempation, I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſin againſt the Lord more; this muſt be a good Thought in thy Mind; How came it there? Who is the Author of this Thought, you will ſay? This ought to be attribured to the Love of God in Chriſt that he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and perſuaded us; and that tho' there is Sin and Pollution, yet he hath not ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken us utterly to caſt us off, he hath ſent forth his <hi>quickening Spirit, that is, the Lord from Heaven,</hi> that he might ſtir up and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en People to conſider their condition, and bring them to a ſenſe of their preſent State, that they may come into a better State than they are in at preſent.</p>
            <p>If this may be granted, that the Spirit of God and the Grace of God is the Author of all theſe Deſires, then it will be granted at the ſame time, that every one of you ought to be ſenſible, that ſuch ſpiritual Deſires ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in you are from the motion and operation of the Spirit of God that hath raiſed them in your Souls, and then I hope, you will grant, that if you had but joined with that Spirit, and with the aſſiſtance of that Spirit, all things would have been poſſible thereunto.</p>
            <p>So that here is the firſt thing that I would have every one ſatisfied about in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,

               </gap> totally exempted from any ſuch Touches and Operations of God or no, for it is ſaid by ſome ignorantly, That a great part of Mankind have never had any ſuch Divine Workings of the Spirit of God upon them, in order to their Converſion; therefore it is not in vain for you to conſider your ſtate and condition, for if you, or I, or any here be under ſuch Circumſtances that they never had, nor are ever like to have any ſuch Divine Operations or Touches of the Spirit of Life, in order to Converſion, then I am ſure you and I had better never have been born.</p>
            <p>If you will conſider with your ſelves and lay aſide the Diſputes of Doctors and Learn'd men, you may know the things pertaining to your ſelves. Things relating to others, I may let Diſputes alone about them, but as for things relating to my Salvation, I muſt have a certain Knowledge of them. It concerns you (my Friends) to know within your ſelves, by an infallible Evidence of the Spirit of God, whether you have had ſuch Divine Touches, Workings and Operations upon your Hearts, as have inclin'd you to ſeek the Lord. I hope I may believ there are none here but have in their Heatrs an Anſwer; I have had ſuch Touches and Operations in me: This is great Love from God more than my Tongue can ſet forth; You will be ready to ſay, I have not deſerv'd this, I have not ſo behaved my ſelf toward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>So that now this is a greater Aggravation of our Sin to continue in it, and yet to have a Belief that God is ſtill waiting upon us, and that he hath ſuch a kindneſs for us, as now and then to touch our Hearts by the inward Operation of his Spirit and Grace, in order to Converſion.</p>
            <p>Now when this is agreed, and Men ſettle themſelves in the belief of this, you know what the conſequence will be. When I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with my ſelf, I that have been under theſe Workings, have been rebellious, wicked and diſobedient to God, yet the Lord is not ſo angry as utterly to caſt me off, but is ſtill waiting to be gracious by the Operation of his Spirit, to gather me to himſelf, in order to ſanctifie me and heal my my Backſliding, to cure my Weakneſs and Infirmities, and at the laſt to ſave me, and make me an Heir of his Eternal Kingdom, What is the conſequence of this Love? Why, the next Reſolve muſt be this, I will rebel againſt his Grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his Power, or I will ſubmit to him; Which of theſe is the beſt way, the ſafeſt way?</p>
            <p>Are there not a great many in this Age that are as ſenſible of the Workings of God's Grace for their Converſion as ever you and <hi>I</hi> were, that are as ſenſible that God hath call'd them to Holineſs and Righteouſneſs as any of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42790:7"/> us can be, and yet they have reſiſted the Grace of God? They have ſaid in their Hearts, We will not ſubmit to this Power, that will make us ſo holy and ſo watchful, and ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, diligent and obedient, for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe it will croſs my Intereſt, it will croſs my Pleaſure, it will hinder my Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World and my Reputation among men; and for this reaſon I will not bear this Yoke. I would be glad to hope there are none ſuch here, that have made ſuch <hi>a Covenant with Death and Hell,</hi> and yielded themſelves up to the Devil, to ſerve him all their Dayes.</p>
            <p>Let us, who are at this Time, and at this Meeting, under the Operation of God's Grace, and do feel the Lord calling us by his Grace, and working upon us by his Spirit; let us enter together into a holy ſolemn Reſolution, That we will obey this good Spirit, and take him for our Leader, and ſubmit, though it ſhould be to a Croſs: Thus People will think they will come to this Reſolution; when the Work of Redemption is begun in their Souls, and when they are convinced of their Sin, and their Eyes are opened to ſee the way of Holineſs; and though they never take a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to walk in it, yet every one ſhall be convinced, and ſee there was a better wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When People come to the right Object of their Faith, and act their Faith upon that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they every Day find a Progreſs, a going forward in the Work of Grace, according to the Work of Faith in their Souls; and there is a Power that inclines them to believe; it is not for ſuch to cry, If they had Power they would do more; he that hath the Spirit of Grace, the Spirit of Chriſt that had <hi>all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Heaven and Earth given</hi> to him, to put it forth on purpoſe for the bringing back of Men and Women home to God; he that hath this Object of Faith before him, he will not look for Power in his own Will and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to redeem him, he expects a Power to be daily miniſtred and diſpenſed to him, as he hath need of it, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is preſent with him in all his Tryals and Temptations; He cries, Here is a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that will carry me away, O Lord help me, <hi>Put forth the Arm of thy Power and ſave
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42790:8"/> me,</hi> plant thy Fear in my heart and deliver me, <hi>Their Eyes ſhall ſee their Saviour,</hi> ſaith the Prophet.</p>
            <p>Thus when a Man comes to be joined to the right Object of Faith, and doth exerciſe and put forth lively Acts of Faith upon Chriſt, hi Eyes ſhall ſee his Saviour, the light that ſhines into his Heart diſcovers to him the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and it alſo ſhews him a Redeemer at hand, his Saviour is nigh him and he truſteth in him, and relies upon him, and ſays, This Word of God is in my Heart, and I do really believe, that although the Temptation that aſſaults me be ſtrong, yet it ſhall not prevail; whether it be the Profits, the Pleaſures or the Honours of the World, if I put my Truſt in this Power, I cannot go near the Evil; I am a Chriſtian, I am entred into a Covenant in Chriſtianity that I will joyn with nothing but what God approves of; now when I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to my Mind the Temptation of the Devil, and that evil which he ſets before me, and I know it is contrary to the Mind of God, How can I go into that evil, and break my Covenant with God, after I am entred into Covenant with him, to love him, ſerve him and obey him? the Power of Grace upon ſuch Souls, the Operation of Grace is ſo powerful, that the Temptation comes and goes, and they are ſaved and delivered out of it, becauſe God helpeth them; but if they comply with the Temptation, then <hi>Tribulation Wrath and Anguiſh</hi> purſues all ſuch as are rebellious and diſobedient to the Will of God.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:42790:9"/>
            <p>Now this Redemption is carried on gradually, from day to day, the Truth that thou believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it operates by degrees; thou art delivered, firſt from one evil Practice, and then from another evil Work; but there is a great deal more, thou rejoiceſt and art glad that thou art delivered from one ſin, but thou wouldeſt be more glad to be delivered from them all: I ſpeak to thoſe that are ſerious for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, when they ſee themſelves deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of one Evil, that they were ready to run into, they would be glad that they were redeemed out of every evil, that their croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perverſneſs, their frowardneſs and Wantonneſs were removed, they ſhould be glad to be delivered from all their Sins.</p>
            <p>What do you think, ſay ſome, that a Man, while he liveth here may come to ſee all Sin, all Evil and Corruption brought under, and nothing but Holineſs and Righteouſneſs and Truth remain in him, and that there ſhall be nothing but Simplicity and Innocence? Do you think that ſuch a thing can be?</p>
            <p>Why ſhould not I think ſo? You will grant me, That the Power of Grace is able to get ſuch Power and Victory over Sin and Corruption, that you may come to hate it as much as ever you have loved it, if you grant me that the Conſequence will follow, he that gave me Victory over Sin can give me Power over all Sin. All Chriſtians believe, That God's Power is infinite, the Scripture teſtifies, <hi>All things to be poſſible to God, with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42790:9"/> whom we have to do:</hi> If all things be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to God, ſure this is poſſible; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo contrary to God as Sin is, and God will not ſuffer the Devil always to rule his Maſterpiece, Man: Mankind is God's Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erpiece, the moſt eminent Creature in this lower World, made after God's likeneſs; and though the Devil hath brought Men into his own likeneſs now, yet nothing can be more contrary to the Mind of God, than that the Devil ſhould have the Rule of us, for God would have the Government of us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>When we conſider the infiniteneſs of God's Power for deſtroying that which is contrary to him, who can believe that the Devil muſt ever ſtand and prevail?

            <p>I have heard ſome learned Men ſay, That a Believer is a Servant of Sin, and he is ever like to be ſo; but he is not at the ſame time free from Righteouſneſs, for he hath the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him, and God looks upon him as righteous in his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; there cannot be a more Anti-apoſtolical Doctrin, I may be a ſervant of Sin and yet have the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I may be a Servant of Sin (ſay they) yet Chriſt is Righteous, he is the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and he <hi>hath fulfilled the will of God, and hath purchaſed ſalvation</hi> for me, and he is the Object by which I am made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>

            <p>They that are reſigned and given up to Truth, it is poſſible for them that they may be ſatisfied, they have an Infallible Teſtimony <hi>of the Spirit of Truth, witneſſing with their Spirits,</hi> that ſuch a thing is bad, and if they might get the whole World to do it, they will not. What is Profit and Pleaſure to me? My Pleaſure is at Gods right Hand, and my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is to get Grace, and to <hi>have an abundant entrance into Gods Everlaſting Kingdom.</hi> Thoſe that have the true knowledge of Chriſt, they have Profit and Advantage, Pleaſure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light enough, which is hid from the World, and ever will be. They are for Profit and Pleaſure which they may have with a good Conſcience. Thoſe Things which God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords them as Bleſſings in this World; they deſpiſe them not, but take them with Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and uſe them for his Glory: But if they cannot have Profit and Pleaſure without ſinning againſt the Lord and their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, take Profit and Pleaſure that will.</p>
            <p>They that come thus to cloſe with Truth, they have an infallible Evidence within them; they do not conceive it is thus and thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a Man ſaith it is ſo, but they have

            <p>What do you profeſs Infallibility? Elſe I would hold my Tongue; if I did not know what I aſſert infallibly, I would never Preach more; Truth may be many times concealed. A Man may have wronged and cheated his Neighbour and he not know it; this Man goes away and his Neighbour doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him; but when he comes to lie down in his Bed, he hath a ſting and a reproach in his Conſcience, I know I have don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I need not go to learned Men and Logicians to know whether it was a Lie; I am infallible in this, I know certainly it was a Lie, I have a certain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and if a thouſand Men tell me to the contrary, I will not believe them. If there be Infallibility here, is there not then Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility in the word of Truth? Shall I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it, or doubt it, if I have an infallible Teſtimony of it?</p>
            <p>Tho' Men have never ſo little proficiency, if they have it upon ſure Terms and laſting Foundations, let a thouſand Men come with all their Logical Skill and Sophiſm, yet they can never remove a Man from the Witneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You that are under any ſenſe of this, that are come to ſuch an inward ſenſe of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Word of God, if you have heard it reprove you, exhort you, judge you and condemn you, conſider that this <hi>Word</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>out of the Mouth of God,</hi> and not out of the Mouth of any Man. You hear the ſentence of God upon you in your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: Whence comes it? This is out of the Mouth of God. Every Word that comes out of the Mouth of God, adminiſters Life, Senſe and Conviction; and you feel it and receive it, and you may have more familiar Acquaintance with it. There is not a Day or Hour that paſſeth over your Head nor mine, but if we attend to this inward Voice, we may know what it ſpeaks to us, by its Counſels, Doctrins, Reproofs, Convictions and Illuminations; <hi>for the Spirit, ſpeaketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,</hi> with an expreſs ſignification, unto the Spirit of Man; and if he be under a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to tell a Lie, and he comes to a little Pauſe or Queſtion, whether he ſhall tell it or no; if he hearken to this inward Word he will not pauſe long about it, but ſuch a Sentence will ariſe in him, as that to <hi>Joſeph, How can
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42790:19"/> I do this great Wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> How can I ſpeak a Lie, tell a Lie, when in ſo doing I ſin againſt God? Here is a ſentence of Truth, wilt thou receive it or not? No, ſaiſt thou, I will venture to tell a Lie; then ſhalt thou come into the rank of them that do <hi>Deſpite to the Spirit of Grace, that trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Foot the Son of God, and count the Blood of the Covenant an unholy thing.</hi> What Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſuch ſhall have at the latter end, you may read at large in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Now there is a great neceſſity that every one be perſuaded to hearken to this Voice; not only at a Meeting, but on all Occaſions they have in the World. I hope I ſpeak to many ſerious and religious Perſons that are enquiring about their Immortal Souls, what may be beſt for their Souls, whether 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to go on in Wickedneſs or leave off; and that reſolve and ſay, I would be glad to leave my Sins as well as you, if I had Power, and to live a holy Life. As for the want of Power, that you have not Power, I do not wonder at it; for till you come to an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Faith, in that which hath empowered the People of God, in all Ages, I wonder not that you have not Power.

            <p>Where the Devil finds any in their own Hands, as ſuppoſe a religious Perſon of this and the other Religion, who never experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced any thing of this Power of God, but truſteth to his Duties and Performances, this Man is at his own Hand; now ſuch a one the Tempter hath Power over: He can make him cheat his Neighbour, and lead him into Drunkenneſs and Uncleanneſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and into the greateſt Abominations; but if a Man come into an exerciſe of Faith and dependance upon God, and hath left truſting in his own Hands, and ſaith, I ſee I cannot preſerve my ſelf from ſin, I ſee a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of putting my truſt in the Lord, and of waiting upon Gods Power to keep me: If the Tempter come to ſuch a one he cannot prevail, all the Devils in Hell cannot ſtir him one jot; the Devil may tempt him, but he ſtands in the Power of Faith; he knows his Name, and ſaith; <hi>Get thee behind me Satan;</hi> when the Devil comes before him, and lays a Temptation before him, he caſts it behind him; if the Devil riſes up againſt him, he can chain him down, he can ſay in the Name of the Lord, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:42790:20"/>
            <p>This is the Reaſon why many are tempted, and not overtaken; why many are tempted to ſin, and not overcome: How comes it to paſs that we do not do every thing that we are Tempted to? There is ſomething that keeps us; the Devil is not ſo bad to Tempt, but we are as bad in our own Inclinations to yield to him; <hi>The Heart is deceitful above all Things, and deſperately wicked; who can know it?</hi> There is more Wickedneſs in it, than can be uttered. If People be tempted and not overcome, ſomething muſt preſerve them; if there be ſomething that preſerves a Man from any Evil, it can preſerve him from all Evil.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why ſome People are led into Temptation ſometimes and reſiſt it, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſometimes the Temptation ſuits not their Inclination; ſometimes their Reputation lies in the way, ſometimes one thing, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another: But when a thing they are Tempted to, ſuits their Profit and Pleaſure, then away with the fear of God, and nothing ſhall hinder them, I will have my Pleaſure.</p>

            <p>One Sect will ſay, my Tenets are ſo and ſo, and our Ordinances are ſo and ſo, will you come over to us? You ſhall be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our Church.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42790:23"/> removing out of the way the Pride, Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, Enmity, Looſneſs, Wantonneſs and abundance more of evil things, that made the Soul like a Wilderneſs?

God's Word, <hi>like a hammer</hi> and <hi>like a fire,</hi> did break up and <hi>burn up theſe</hi> things; and the ſame Word of God like a Sword did cut down thoſe Sins and Luſts which prevailed over you before: By this means God hath opened a Way for you, to have acceſs to him, and for his Word to have acceſs to you; When you come to the Lord in this way you know you live by this Word, and if you hear the Word of the Lord ſpoken immediately to you, your Joy and Conſolation increaſeth, and you have ſweet Communion and Fellowſhip with God and Chriſt, and with one another, by this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Life.

            <p>O How happy are they that have Bread in their own Houſes! and that can draw Water out of their own Wells! Theſe have a bleſſed glorious Dwelling-place, theſe are the Children that their Father provideth for: All the divine Treaſures and the Riches of Heavenly Things are laid up for theſe; O that all that have a Sight of this bleſſed State, were got into it! that their Minds might no more wander, that People might not be ſcattered in their Thoughts, that when they meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might have their Expectations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely from that God whom they profeſs to worſhip: <hi>Lord thou haſt ſaid that thou wilt teach thy people thy ſelf;</hi> here a Cry goes up to the Lord and their Expectations through Faith are pitched upon God; they never meet in vain, but <hi>a well ſprings up</hi> and <hi>the water of life comes</hi> to them, by which they meet with Divine Refreſhments; for, you know, the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42790:25"/> Promiſe that our Lord made to his Diſciples, <hi>He that drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him ſhall never thirst more.</hi> Why, will once Drinking ſerve? Becauſe I have taſted of the Living Water that the Lord Chriſt gives me, will that ſerve? No, but he giveth me a ſubſtantial River, that is the reaſon why I ſhall thirſt no more, it ſhall be in me a <hi>well of living water, ſpringing up to everlaſting life;</hi> bleſſed are the Witneſſes of it, theſe are they that are ſatisfied concerning Religion and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, they are ſatisfied concerning Worſhip, they are looking after no new things; when theſe meet together they meet in the Name of the Lord, and they have their Eyes to him who is a Fountain and they diſcern a Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a Glory that is unſpeakable; and the Glory that is ſpeakable, that appears many times through Inſtruments, will not ſatisfie them; there is ſomething beyond that, which muſt ſatisfie; this will never do it: People will never be ſatisfied with hearing, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfied with ſeeing, till they come to hear and ſee <hi>that which is unutterable,</hi> and then they are ſatisfied; Chriſt had preached many Sermons in the hearing of his Diſciples, and there were a great many ſaid, <hi>That there was never any man ſpake like him,</hi> preached like him; yet one of them that was neareſt to him, and moſt acquainted and intimate with him, after ſome Years meeting and hearing of his Sermons, he cries out, <hi>Shew us the Father, and it ſufficeth us;</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:42790:25"/>
            <p>My Friends, this comes near to many of your States; many of you have heard long, and have heard the ſpeakable Word of God, that which could be uttered, that which could be ſpoken forth, by the Demonſtration of the Holy Ghoſt, by them <hi>that have received it of the Father;</hi> this you have heard long, and yet there are many of you, that if you come to a ſerious Search, you will find a Want, you will find ſtill that you have not that Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that puts you beyond Doubt, beyond Fear; there is ſome thing that ſtands in the way, that hinders your Enjoyment of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Glory, of the unſpeakable Word, and this will never be removed, but by your innocent ſubmitting to the Work of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God in your own Hearts, that ſo you may not only be Believers but come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Baptized, and then all is out of doubt; for our Lord ſaid, <hi>he that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved;</hi> he doth not ſay he may be ſaved, but he ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Woful Experience hath told us in our Days, That a great many have believed the Truth, and yet they are never like to be ſaved, they <hi>have made ſhipwrack of their faith;</hi> but if they had been baptiz'd, if they would have endured the Baptiſm, if they would have been buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, they ſhould have been ſaved, every one of them; and now there are a great many that remain in the Belief of the Truth, and yet they are not Baptized, they are not Dead, not Buried,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42790:26"/> notwithſtanding <hi>they have received like preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faith with us,</hi> that <hi>faith which is of the operation of God,</hi> and that <hi>is alike precious</hi> in its nature to all that do receive it, and would work the ſame effect in all too, if it were not obſtructed; but notwithſtanding they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Faith towards the ſaving of their Souls, yet their Souls are Captives, their Souls are ſubject to Luſts, and Pleaſures, and Vanities, and unto empty and fooliſh Things, and to Paſſions and Corruptions, after they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Faith.</p>
            <p>For if you take one that is a Believer of Truth, that is overtaken with his Luſts, and Paſſions, and Corruptions, he will commonly own that he believeth the contrary, he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that theſe things ſhould not be, that it ought to be otherwiſe: This is the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Truth againſt Untruth; If it ſhould be otherwiſe, why is it thus then? Why, he finds a Life to ſpring up in that which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, that is always contrary to the life of God, and at enmity with it: What ſhall I do? I believe the Truth, I know it is a holy thing, it leads all that ſubmit to it to a holy Life, and there is this and that unholy thing, this and that corrupt thing remains, what ſhall I do?</p>
            <p>It is an evident Demonſtration that thou wanteſt the Baptiſm of him in <hi>whom thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest;</hi> thou haſt believed in Chriſt Jeſus that cometh after <hi>John,</hi> and was before him, and now having believed in him, thou wanteſt to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42790:26"/> be baptized by him, and for want of that, the Pollution and Corruption that was grown up in thy nature, in the time of thy alienation, prevails ſtill upon thee, contrary to thy Faith; and there is no coming to obtain this Baptiſm but by ſinking down into that which will ſlay thee, that which will kill thee: But there is ſuch a ſhifting to ſave ones Life, there are ſo many twiſtings and twinings of People to ſave their Lives, that at laſt they loſe them; but there are none that could ever find that Life that is Eternal, but thoſe that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be given up to the Dead, and ſubmit to this Baptiſm, that is by the Holy Ghoſt and by Fire: theſe only do come to Life, they come to the Reſurrection, for you never knew any that dyed this Death but they roſe again; it is as impoſſible for Death to hold any one down that is buried in this Baptiſm, as it was impoſſible to hold Chriſt down, when he was in the Grave; <hi>The ſame power that brought again our Lord Christ from the dead, the ſame power it is that quickens us,</hi> while we remain in theſe mortal Bodies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have ſuſtain'd this Death and Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiction.</p>
            <p>But who can believe this Saying? for <hi>this is a hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that I am a Believer, which makes me a Friend, and entitles me to a Community among you, and as long as I hold the Truth and profeſs the Truth I am looked upon as one of your Society? This is very true, this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42790:27"/> doth entitle People unto the outward Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the Church of Chriſt; but there is another inner Court, that lies under the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel's Reed, the meaſuring Reed, that is to be meaſured, the Temple is meaſured, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Worſhipper in the Temple is meaſured; there was an outward Court, that was for repreſenting the Church of God in general from the particular; the outward Court was not meaſured, that the Gentiles might come in; the unbaptized People which were never regenerated they might come ſo far as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court, but this did not entitle them to the Privileges of the Houſe of God, nor to any Worſhip or Sacrifice that was accepted upon God's Altar.</p>
            <p>It concerns you and me (my Friends) to be ſerious about Matters of this Moment and Importance, and not ſpend your Dayes, and, as it were, ſpeak by rote, under an airy Profeſſion, though of Truth it ſelf, without conſidering what Progreſs you have made, what benefit you have obtained, and whether you are come not only to <hi>the ſhadow of good things to come,</hi> but to the very Subſtance of the heavenly things; <hi>for the comers to the outward worſhip could never with thoſe Sacrifices they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd be made perfect; the comers thereunto were not made perfect as to things pertaining to the conſcience,</hi> ſpeaking there of the outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. but coming to the heavenly things, whereof the other were but a ſhadow, they made People perfect, as to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42790:27"/> and did bring them to Salvation. The Apoſtle alludes to this Baptiſm, for he ſpeaks in a Figure of the <hi>Eight perſons that were ſaved in</hi> Noah<hi>'s ark;</hi> then he brings down the Allegory to Chriſtian Baptiſm, not only to the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> the fore-runner of Chriſt, that preached of Chriſt, but to the Chriſtian Baptiſm it ſelf; <hi>by the like figure, whereof baptiſm now ſaveth us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience.</hi> What doth he mean by Baptiſm ſaving us? He means, <hi>the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, through the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead;</hi> ſo that Chriſtian Baptiſm did bring along with it the <hi>cleanſing and putting away of all ſin out of the conſcience</hi> that might bring them under Doubts and Scruples; and then there is an ariſing of Jeſus, the Saviour, in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Mediator that brought them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for them in the Sight of God; for if People be conſcious of Sin, and do leave off their Sin, this doth not yet cleanſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; for there ſtill remains a Conſcience of Sin; 'tis not the leaving off our Sin, that makes our Attonement with God, or that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piates our Guilt, or doth away the Guilt of the Sins that we have committed; but there muſt be a forſaking and a leaving off Sin by the Vertue and Power of the Spirit, by which we are enabled not only to leave off Sin, but are guided and directed to the Mediator, <hi>whoſe blood alone reconcileth us to God, and cleanſeth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42790:28"/> us from all ſin.</hi> If I ſhould never commit a ſin, while I live, it is not this ſimply in it ſelf that will make me have the anſwer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the ſight of God; for there remains the guilt of ſin contracted in the Days of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, which is a bar and hinderance that none can approach the Holy God but in the attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Salvation that comes by Jeſus Chriſt; for all that believe and obey the Goſpel are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in Chriſt, and upon the account of Chriſts precious Blood that cleanſeth us from all ſin and unrighteouſneſs. Whom doth it cleanſe? thoſe only that forſake their ſins and by his power are brought to a holy life; they by the vertue of his power and the cleanſing of his Blood come to have their former ſins removed from them, as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt,</p>
            <p>But what is this to them that remain in their Sins? what is this <hi>to them that are not baptiſed? for the dead that have not put off the old Man, nor put on the new Man,</hi> but have only put on the name and profeſſion of Chriſt, and put on the outſide of him, his Garment, but have not put him on, they are not <hi>Created again in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, that they might walk in them;</hi> no wonder there remains a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſin in them, there is a Bar that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from the ſight of the glory of God, and from real and true ſatisfaction, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their attonement and reconcilation with God, and this hinders them from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>that peace that paſſeth underſtanding;</hi> and it is no wonder, becauſe they are not come
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42790:28"/> to this baptiſm that brings the <hi>anſwer of a good conſcience in the ſight of God;</hi> they are not riſen with Chriſt; how ſhould they? for they are not buryed with him, Rom. 6.3. <hi>know ye not that ſo many of us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as were baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Chriſt were baptiſed into his death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are buried with him by baptiſm into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life;</hi> here is a change figured out between them that had partaken of the ſpiritual baptiſm, and were come again to the participation of life in the reſurrection of Chriſt Jeſus; and thoſe that were not baptized.</p>
            <p>So it is now with every one that cometh to believe the truth, and maketh a profeſſion of it; there is a way caſt up, and there is a door opened for ſalvation; but the grand queſtion that every one ought to enquire about, and put to themſelves is, What progreſs they have made in this way? Whether they are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized yet or no? Whether they have <hi>Put off the old Man and his deeds, and put on the new Man and the new Mans deeds, which are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and holineſs?</hi> They that find that though they are believers, they are ſhort of this, they do alſo find that their ſhortneſs is their hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, their ſhortneſs in not coming up to the pattern that hath bin ſhewed them, is their hinderance ſo that they enjoy not the things here ſpoken of; the being under this ſenſe and really ſitting under this ſenſe in a Meeting, though there ſhould be no Man ſpeaking to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42790:29"/> them outwardly, yet being come to this faith, and made partakers of this baptiſm, People would find in their own Boſoms the hidden Word of life miniſtring to their condition; they would have enough, there would not be a famin of the Word unto them, nor they ſhould not need to be in expectation of going out to this or the other Inſtrument, but they would be ſatiſfied when they are met together with the preſence of the Lord, that the Lord is in midſt of them, miniſtring to them the Word of life, in his operating and working, ſpeaking in a tongue that every one can underſtand it, ſpeaking with a kind of Voice and Language, that every one may underſtand his own ſtate and condition; and this is the way that God brought up People at the beginning, to the knowledge of Heavenly things, and opening of the myſteries of Salvation; we had it not of Men, but of Jeſus our Lord; he was our great miniſter, we waited upon him and truſted in him, and he taught us himſelf; he hath mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to us at our ſilent and quiet waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him thoſe things that were convenient for us; we might well ſay <hi>he gave us our Food in due ſeaſon;</hi> he hath not only given <hi>ſtrong Meat unto Men,</hi> but hath miniſtred of the <hi>ſincere Milke of his word unto Babes,</hi> that lived in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and ſelf-denyal, loving God above all things; and he taught and conducted us in our way, this way of ſimplicity, until our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings came to be opened, until our Souls came to be prepared to receive the myſteries of his Kingdom.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:42790:29"/>
            <p>In thoſe Days there were ſome that ſtarted up in Knowledge, and that <hi>built their Nets on high, and took Flax and Wool, and Silver and Gold, and decked themſelves with them;</hi> but the Lord found them out, and brought them down, and took the Crown from their Head, and cloathed them with Diſhonour: So God doth from Age to Age, his Judgments will begin at his own Houſe; if you would <hi>Grow in the grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> then grow in humility and ſelf-denyal, and keep a conſtant watch upon your Hearts; examine your Hearts, and <hi>Commune with your ſelves upon your Beds, and be ſtill;</hi> take heed leſt you ſin againſt the Lord, and provoke him: <hi>There were ſome that provoked the Lord of old, and they commited two great evils: What be they? They have gon away, and forſaken the Fountain of living Water;</hi> as much as to ſay, they have not their dependance upon an invſiable power, as they ought to have; for I am a living fountain and tis by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible power that I am able to councel, and teach, direct, and purify and open their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but they have forſaken me, that is one great evil; and the other is, they would not be without ſomewhat, <hi>they have forſaken the Lord</hi> and they would have ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of God; <hi>They have digged to themſelves broken Ciſterns, that will hold no Water.</hi> And how many in this Age have committed theſe two great evils?</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:42790:30"/>
            <p>My Friends, examine your ſelves; are there not many that have been guilty of theſe two great Evils? They do not keep their cloſe dependence, truſt and reliance upon the inviſible Power of God, as they profeſs they ought to do, but are hurried away from it; ſome by the love of the World, ſome by Luſts and Pleaſures, ſome by Paſſions and others by worldly Intereſts, are drawn away from the Power, to do and ſay that which the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is againſt: Is not this a forſaking of the Lord the living Fountain? What do they do then? Are they not for this and that, and the other Man? for hearing this and the other Mans word, and <hi>digging to themſelves broken Ciſterns?</hi> And have they not their truſt and confidence in going to Meetings, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending this and the other way? Have they not their truſt in their Profeſſion outwardly, when it miniſters nothing to their Souls, ſo that they ſecretly wither for all this? If you had all the Men and Angels that were ever ſent of God appointed to preach to you, that could not miniſter Life to you, unleſs there be that Faith that ſtands in the Power of God. The Faith that ſtands in any Mans Words, that will not overcome your Luſts, but the Faith that ſtands in the Power <hi>purifies the Heart,</hi> it will not ſuffer any unclean thing there. As for Preaching, let a Man preach againſt this and the other Luſt and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there it will remain for all his Preaching, unleſs Men know Gods Power and Life in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42790:30"/> which there is Righteouſneſs; for Words and Knowledge, and Sight and Speculation, will never give People Victory over their Sins.</p>
            <p>Therefore you know, every one who is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led muſt be ſetled where the Foundation of Religion is; it is not coming to Meetings, and owning this and the other Doctrin which is the Foundation of our Religion; God hath revealed his Power to every one of us; God hath not given his Spirit to Preachers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets only, for then there would be a <hi>Famine of the Word,</hi> as was in <hi>Iſrael, The Prieſt's Lips preſerved Knowledge.</hi> If you did take away the Prieſt you did take away their Knowledge. The Prophets had the Word of God, and they only ſpake the Word of God. If the Prophet was taken away, then the Word of God was taken away. The Lord threatned to ſend a Famine among them, they grieved and vexed, and killed and deſtroyed the Prieſts and Prophets; therefore, ſaith th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Lord, <hi>I will ſend a Famine among you, not of Bread but of the Word, and they ſhall go from City to City, and enquire for the Word of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it was in the Jewiſh Church; if there was a Prophet they would go 30, 40 or 100 Miles to him that had the Word of the Lord, <hi>They ſhall go from City to City, to enquire for the Word of the Lord:</hi> But bleſſed be God we are come to another Day, for now the Word of the Lord is manifeſted in the Hearts of all that believe; they know the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42790:31"/> Word: I do not ſay all that believe do preach the Word, or ought to preach; but the Word preacheth to them; they are not as <hi>broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns that can hold no Water;</hi> when they find the Word and hear it, they ſpeak it preſently; what is miniſtred to their own Condition, that they tell to other Folks; when People come to the Bleſſing of this Diſpenſation that Gods Word revealeth in their Hearts, they then know what the ſignification of it is, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Doctrin of it, the Doctrin preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Holineſs to them; not that they ſhould preach Holineſs and yet remain Unholy; not that they ſhould preach Humility, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Proud: It preacheth Holineſs, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Singleneſs of Heart to a Remnant, that like good Scholars and Diſciples learn the Leſſons and Doctrin of the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Now when thou haſt learned them well, and art come to ſee the effect of the Word, and doſt bring forth the Deeds and Works which are the Fruits of Holineſs, <hi>Perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God, and with Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity known and witneſſed in Christ Jeſus,</hi> and art not only meek in ſhew, but <hi>meek and lowly in Heart;</hi> when People come to be meek and lowly, and of a clear Conſcience, <hi>purged from all dead Works to ſerve the living God;</hi> then if the Lord gives them a Word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, of Doctrin or Counſel, it is very welcome, and it hath a Savour through the Bleſſing of God, and they come by it to be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42790:31"/> 
               <hi>built up in their most holy Faith,</hi> and this Word is brought forth in Holineſs and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in their Lives, and ſhews it ſelf in a Life of Holineſs; then thou wilt ſhine in thy Converſation to all that thou converſeſt with, ſo that they may ſee thee to be ſuch a Man or Woman as haſt been with Jeſus, and learned of Jeſus, and receivedſt <hi>a word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted;</hi> when thou doſt receive the Word into thy Heart, there is the engrafting of it: If it hath not Root there, then, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>My Word doth not abide in you.</hi> If you feel ſomething of this Inviſible Word in your Hearts, it brings you to a Reſolution to ſerve God, and to keep your ſelves from ſin, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Profeſſion which you make of God, this is the effect of the Word of God, if it doth abide in you. Doth it abide? You ſhall know anon or to morrow, ſo ſoon as a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation comes to ſtir you up to Pride or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to Fraud or Deceit, then you will ſee whether the Word abide: If it abide you ſin not.</p>
            <p>This is Scripture, a certain Foundation Doctrin, that may be as ſafely preached as any Doctrin: If the Word abide in you, you ſin not; What of that? Let the Word go, and you will ſin, when ever you are tempted to it. <hi>I write to you young Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have overcome the wicked one, you are ſtrong, and the Word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.</hi> We ſhall ſee as ſoon as a Temptation meets with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42790:32"/> thee, whether the Word abides in thee; if it abide thou wilt not ſin, but reſiſt the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter. Set thy Foot upon the Temptation, and go over it, and thou wilt have the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; and this will make thee a Free-man or Woman, and thou wilt <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made thee free.</hi> The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth them free, and that they have got Dominion; then <hi>Stand fast,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made thee free.</hi> It is a liberty not of Luſt and Sin, but a liberty of the Soul; the Soul now is not at the Devil's Will and Call.</p>
            <p>For it is a ſhame to the Doctrin of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that we profeſs things, and yet deny them in Practice: We profeſs that there is a Power in Chriſt to keep and preſerve us out of ſin, and we profeſs to believe this Power is communicated to them that do believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for their Preſervation; that is, he will not with-hold it from them: We profeſs theſe things in the face of the whole World, and yet when the Devil calls one Man to Covetouſneſs, and another to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his Neighbour, and another to defile himſelf, he is drawn away thereby; what Hypocriſy is here to profeſs this, and act the contrary? I do not wonder that they that profeſs they cannot live a day without Sin, that they ſhould fall; but they that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe there is Power enough in Chriſt, and that it is offered to them, for them to live in ſin and yield to temptation, this
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42790:32"/> is horrid Wickedneſs. They that are of an upright ſingle Mind, would die before they would ſin, knowing that God is Almighty, and gracious and willing to beſtow his Power, and Wiſdom, and Grace, upon them that ask it; they would die rather than ſin againſt God preſumptuouſly: Let it coſt me my Goods, my Eſtate, my Liberty or my Life, <hi>How can I do this great Wickedneſs, and ſin against God?</hi> They love God above all; you never heard them complain that they wanted Power, <hi>For the Lord is at their right Hand, and they ſhall not be moved.</hi> They cannot fall; tho' they are Tempted, they will not fall into Temptation. They have Power when they ſee the Devil before them, to put him behind them; the Nobility of their Extract, of their new Birth and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration puts ſuch a Temper and Diſpoſition into their Souls, that they ſcorn to be at the Devils Command, as if they were his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.</p>
            <p>Oh it is a noble and honourable thing to be a Child of God, a very high Dignity to be in ſuch an honourable Relation to God, and to have a Right to the Heavenly Manſions, <hi>To ſit down in heavenly Places in Christ Jeſus.</hi> I would to God you were all ready for it, that you had the Wedding Garment on, that you might not be <hi>bound Hand and Foot, and cast into utter Darkneſs.</hi> What is the reaſon that you do not ſit down in this heavenly Frame and Temper, and draw the Waters
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42790:33"/> of Salvation our of your own Souls; Could the Lord do any thing more than he hath done, and could his Servants do any more than they have done for your Help? Are not their Labours demonſtrations of it? We have been <hi>as Epiſtles of Chriſt written in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences:</hi> We have been teſtifying that there is ſomething wanting in too too many, the want of reſigning up themſelves to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the Croſs. People are willing to be counted Friends; but they are Friends of God, <hi>that do whatſoever he commandeth 'em;</hi> that is the Chriſtian Leſſon, not to ſay, I will be a Friend to you and a Friend to the Church, and to ſuch a ſort of People; but I will be a Friend of God, and do whatſoever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth me, whatſoever Command God lays upon you, either to take up a Croſs, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your ſelves and follow him.</p>
            <p>Learn this Leſſon, and you will be Diſciples indeed, and Members of the Church too; not Members of a Church priviledged out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly only, but <hi>members of a church of the firſt-born, and you will have your names writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heaven;</hi> when one comes to have his Name written in Heaven, he comes to know his Name, 'tis a <hi>white Stone,</hi> not a ſpeckled one; they that have it they know it, they are not ignorant of one another's Names, that are written in this Book; they have a Fellowſhip that no body can declare; their Communion is in that Bread and that Cup: This is a Cup of Bleſſing indeed, and this hath bleſſed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42790:33"/> us and will bleſs us; God will preſerve a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this Fellowſhip. You that are at a diſtance now, you muſt come nearer to him; God will chuſe a People by whom his Name ſhall be magnified; Becauſe <hi>the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts,</hi> we cannot but deſire this for all, <hi>eſpecially for the houſhold of faith;</hi> we cannot but deſire their Perfection, their growing up in the Grace of God, that they might come to be partakers of Heaven. And, in the next Place, our Love is to all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, every where; we would be glad <hi>that all were ſaved;</hi> they that deſpiſe us, when we are ſpeaking of Heavenly things, ſpeaking like a Child, like a ſtammering Child, ſpeaking of the glorious Excellencies of God, of the loving kindneſs of God, ſpeaking of thoſe things which God hath ſpoken to our Souls, they that deſpiſe theſe things, we would be glad that they might be ſaved: If they were partakers of theſe things, they would be glad as well as we and they would be more really happy in reſpect of this World, for the Time that they are to live here; they would live a happier Life, even in this World, and they would <hi>have everlaſting life in the world to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains men thus to judge, that every one that hath received like precious faith,</hi> ought to anſwer that Grace and Faith which God hath miniſtred to them in a holy Life and Converſation, and every one who is a ſtranger to this thing, ought to be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42790:34"/> of an enquiring Mind and an open Heart to wait for the Day when God will viſit them with the ſame Grace; when you give up your ſelves to a daily Croſs, as Chriſt's Diſciples, you will not be running after any one to teach you to know the Lord, for you will all <hi>know the Lord, from the leaſt to the greateſt;</hi> I that have been but a little convinc'd, ſhall I know the Lord? Thou ſhalt know the Lord, thou that <hi>art dead in thy ſins and treſpaſſes,</hi> thou that haſt not <hi>known the Blood of cleanſing,</hi> thou ſhalt know <hi>the Lord</hi> to be thy <hi>Judge,</hi> and thy <hi>Law-giver,</hi> to teach thee how thou muſt live, walk and act; and is not that a good knowledg? This is the way they reckoned upon in old Time, it is a notable Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>The Lord is our Judge;</hi> there is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he began there, Judgment began <hi>at the houſe of God;</hi> thoſe he brings into his Houſe, he brings them under the Diſcipline of his Houſe, <hi>The Lord is our judge, he is our king and law-giver, and he will ſave us;</hi> this ſame Exerciſe of Diſcipline under Judgment brought to them the Faith and Experience of his being their Law-giver, and this brought them to a Faith of the laſt Sentence, we ſhall be ſaved; and the Lord anſwers ſuch a People, That he will bring ſalvation to them, <hi>Salvation ſhall be for walls and bulwarks:</hi> Did the People of this Nation but know Salvation was brought near to them, and that it was their Bulwark, there would not be a crying up this and the other rotten thing for a Bulwark.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:42790:34"/>
            <p>We talk of a Bulwark as well as others; we have a Bulwark, bleſſed be the God of Heaven, made of better Stuff than theirs; for it is the Salvation of God which hath kept us from the Pollution of Sin, and from a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>into all exceſs and riot</hi> that others have run into; it hath kept us from the Evil, it hath kept Evils out of us, and we have found that certainly true, That <hi>all things work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good, to them that love God and fear God;</hi> that all the Providences of God toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they have all wrought for our good; and this is the Bulwork that we have truſted in, and it hath ſerved hitherto, and it will ſerve us and our Poſterity to the end of the World: This is a Bulwark that will never be ſtormed, that will never be thrown down nor laid waſte: Though all the Powers on Earth, and all the Potentates in this World ſhould agree together, they ſhall not prevail againſt it; we have <hi>ſalvation for walls and bulwarks;</hi> if I be within theſe Walls, Salvation is round about me; If I am got into this eternal Bulwark, I am ſafe from the Devil and his Inſtruments; here is a Bulwark to be relied upon.</p>
            <p>Many wonder we differ with them in ſome Opinions; we have that Confidence in this Bulwark, that we deſire not another; God will laſt and abide for ever, ſo will this Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark; all the care that I take, and all the care that you ſhould take, is to keep within theſe Walls: Do not ſally out, if you go out, the the Devil is watching, and <hi>ſeeking continually
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42790:35"/> whom he may devour;</hi> he will catch Straglers; if that People will go out for Profit or for Pleaſure, or Intereſt, the Devil will catch them: What, ſuch People talk of Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks? the Devil hath got them in his Snare, and they are caught in Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Uncleanneſs and other Sins; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is they have gone out of their Bulwark, they have ſallyed out of their Walls, for the Devil could never have fetched them out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O take heed,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>leſt there ſpring up in any of you an evil heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, in departing from the living God;</hi> as if he had ſaid, You are Chriſtians now, you are a People come to a good eſtate in Chriſt; but conſider you have no ſtrength to ſtand but in him, no Power to keep your ſelves but in him; <hi>Take heed</hi> at all times <hi>that there ſpring not up in you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God;</hi> take heed leſt there ſpring up in you ſuch a Thought as this; I may take this Pleaſure and the other Profit; Conſider that thou dieſt and withereſt if thou depart from the living God; take heed of taking Liberty above the fear of God: It is not our talk of Salvation for Walls and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, that will do us good, but our keep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing within theſe Walls.</p>
            <p>I remember a notable Saying of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which hath a great Emphaſis in it, and a great deal of Doctrin, he writeth to the Church, after they were become a People of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42790:35"/> profeſſing Chriſtians, <hi>Take heed leſt you come to be beguiled by the ſerpent, as he beguiled Eve;</hi> he did not ſpeak of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> a wicked Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but he ſpoke of <hi>Eve</hi> a good Woman, <hi>created after the image of God, in righteouſneſs and holineſs;</hi> They were come to a Life of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, to a Life <hi>that was hidden from ages and generations;</hi> You muſt look to your ſelves, and look upon your ſelves as in the ſtate of your Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> a Woman brought forth in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, that might have ſtood in that Primitive ſtate, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Subtilty of all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents in the World; but letting her Ear hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to this Old Serpent, ſhe was beguiled; there grew up a Conſultation in her reaſoning part; It may be ſo as he ſaith, I will try.</p>
            <p>So I ſay to you that are come to a ſtate of Sanctification, and in ſome meaſure to know the cleanſing Power of God, and that you have not believed in it in vain, but it hath effectually wrought ſome Change and Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in you, and is ſtill carrying on the Work of your Salvation: Many Temptations will attend you, and many Snares will be laid in your way, but God hath preſerved you to this Day: I know the Devil's Wiles and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations are manifold; they are fitted to every one's Inclinations, fitted to every Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and to every occaſion in this World; Men are tryed every way by the Tempter, to ſee which way he may enſnare them; he tries every way to <hi>enſnare</hi> and entangle <hi>the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42790:36"/> ſimple,</hi> that he may turn them to the right-Hand or to the left, that their Souls may be deſtroyed and periſh.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſpeak to you by a more empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical word, by a more familiar Exhortation than this, <hi>Take heed you be not beguiled as Eve was;</hi> many will be tempted as ſhe was, but I would not have you do as ſhe did, and yield to the Temptation: Take heed that you do not defile your ſelves, but <hi>keep your garments white;</hi> you that have been waſhed and cleanſed, labour to <hi>keep your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted from the world; this is pure religion and undefiled,</hi> that which hath enlightned many a Nation, and ſhall enlighten many of thoſe whoſe Religion is to be undefiled, and to <hi>keep themſelves unſpotted from the world:</hi> I pray God increaſe the number of them, that ſo the bleſſed Work of Sanctification that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in this way may be carried on, to his Praiſe and the Salvation of our Souls, to the ſpreading forth of his Glory, and the exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Name; that the Strangers which are ſcattered and deſolate may be brought into his holy Way and walk in it; that we all, in a Fellowſhip together, walking in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way, may through the Eternal Spirit offer Praiſe and Tankſgiving to God, who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receive Glory and Honour, Power and Dominion for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

If they be none of Chriſt's that have not his Spirit, whoſe are they? They are all his whoſe Spirit rules them, every one of us doth belong to him whoſe Spirit ruleth over us, unto whoſe Power we are ſubjected. You know this diſtinguiſheth People in the World, One King knoweth his Subjects from another King's Subjects, they are under the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this, that and the other King or Prince, his Law is over them, they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it, ſo here is a Deciſion of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World, who they belong to.</p>

            <p>We, all of us, I hope, do expect there will be a Deciſion at the Day of Judgment, and believe the things we read concerning that, That there will be a Deciſion, and ſome will be placed on the right-Hand and ſome on the left-Hand; ſome will have the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> and others the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Go ye curſed;</hi> but now there is a way of finding out the Deciſion of the Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we go out of the World, before the Day of Judgment, when there will be no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that is, then it muſt be and abide ſo; now there is no need it ſhould continue ſo; if it be amiſs it may be mended, if I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the right Prince, if I be not under the right Power and Spirit, I may be, for now it is a day of Grace, a day of Mercy; I have been a Rebel to the right Prince. I may be pardoned and taken into Favor; it is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for People to know their ſtate now than to know it then, becauſe then there will be no Remedy.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle, in laying down Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Apoſtolical Doctrines that were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived and taken notice of, and are in our Age, ſo that we may ſay, <hi>Things written of old time were written for our learning,</hi> he makes this Affirmation and Poſition of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>He that hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt is none of his,</hi> he doth not belong to him; if he be called a Chriſtian he is not a Chriſtian, if he hath not the Spirit of Chriſt; It is but a Name he hath got, he hath not that which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42790:37"/> makes him eſſentially ſo, for nothing can make a Chriſtian but having the Spirit of Chriſt; therefore when they would vindicate their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians, they prove it thus; <hi>For he</hi> (ſpeaking of God) <hi>hath ſent the ſpirit of his Son into our hearts, and we know the mind of Christ, we know him that is true,</hi> or we are in him that is true; Theſe things, if they were right, if they were true, were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Demonſtrations that they were a ſort of Men who depended more upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Spirit and ſpiritual Teachings and Spiritual Guidance than upon Rules and Methods of Teaching that were in the World.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak of this, Friends, becauſe you know as well as I, how averſe this Age of ours hath been, to have any thing ſpoken of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Diſpenſations, or about ſpiritual Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; though a Man hath been counted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a wiſe Man, a learned Man, a Man of parts, if once he come to ſmatter out a little about inward Teaching, it is enough to ſpot him and make him ridicul'd of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as if there were no ſuch thing in the World; We have a Book, called <hi>the Bible,</hi> it is from one end to the other full of ſuch Expreſſions, of being led by the Spirit, <hi>you have an anointing which teacheth you all things;</hi> The whole Tenor of the New Teſtament is about Spiritual Teaching and Divine Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and of <hi>Faith</hi> being <hi>the operation of God;</hi> and the Old Teſtament hath abundance of Expreſſions by way of Prophecy, that in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42790:38"/> the New Teſtament Dayes, if People would look for the Law of God, they muſt look for it <hi>in their Hearts,</hi> and if they would know God they muſt look to <hi>the mediator, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> The New Teſtament ſeems to go that way, Chriſtians ſhould be the moſt Spiritual People in the World, that is the Guide, the Rule.</p>
            <p>But, ſay they, the Scripture is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith and Manners, Belief and Practice; this is but Diſſimulation, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that is to be found in ſome; What is the Scripture the Rule of Faith? and may People believe what they find in Scripture? Yes, but ſay ſome, it is beſt be aware for fear of Error; What is in the Scripture is ſerious, ſound and orthodox, and did Quakers, think you, never find in Scripture that People were to <hi>wait for the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>pray in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>ſerve God in the Spirit,</hi> and that all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that is not in Power is not available, did they not find it in the Scripture? And you that are not Quakers, Did you ever read the New Teſtament? How came it to paſs that ye never found theſe Texts? But ſome People read and read the New Teſtament twenty times over, and mock, and deride, and perſecute a Man that ſhall ſpeak of the Spirits Teaching.</p>
            <p>I have admired at it, how intelligent Men, to whom God hath given a competent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſhould be ſo blinded; they have learned to read Engliſh, and they have read

            <p>It hath been hitherto looked upon as an Invention, to ſpeak of the <hi>teaching of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>waiting upon the Spirit,</hi> and being moved by the Spirit.

            <p>O the blindneſs that hath happened to this Nation!

            <p>Here a parcel of form-makers all fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the meaning of the word; what remedy can any mortal Man provide for this?

There is none now a days ſay the Proteſtants, and ſay the Papiſts there is none but one that hath this infallibility; and they will not ſuppoſe that neither, for ſome of them ſay, that one Man is as infallible as another Man; there is a great brangle, whether any one Man be infallible or a great many men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are infallible about Doctrin and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: This might be cured all at once if we could come to this concluſion, Papiſts, Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and Quakers, here is an end of all their out-ſide Worſhip, <hi>He that hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt is none of his:</hi> If there be not ſpirit in it it is not Chriſts Religion and Worſhip.</p>

            <p>I would queſtion whether thouſands find the Truth of it.

It is very true, ſtand to thy Church; if this Security that is taken for a Child be but effectual, then there is no doubt of being a Child of God and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.

So men now a days, they have a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm wherewith they are baptized, but Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with <hi>the Holy Ghoſt and with fire</hi> is the right Baptiſm, therefore do not baptize until you find the Holy Ghoſt, this will be far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; this is the Baptiſm that they which come to know it are ſure of Salvation by it, for by this Baptiſm they are born up and tinctured in their Souls with the Divine Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, proceeding from the Father and the Son till they receive his Likeneſs, and ſo die unto Sin; <hi>As many as were baptized were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Chriſt's death.</hi> He openeth it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>in that he died he died unto ſin once, but in that he liveth he liveth unto God; ſo that they that were baptized were baptized into Chriſt's Death, and you that are dead unto ſin, how ſhould you live any longer therein?</hi>

            <p>We had never ſuch a Thought, God knows, there is nothing that our Souls long after more; but people have been making a kind of Work of their own, they have loſt a Reality, and make Shadows as Children do, who when they ſee things made in the Houſe for Service, they will make the like in Sand and Clay: Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not ſee what a great thing it is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Supper of the Lord; as things came into an Evangelical Opening they ſpake then more lively and freſhly of things, <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock; if any man open to me I will come in and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> For the underſtanding of this Text: If you go and examine and ſearch all the Commentators you can find, ſee what the learned Men ſay of it, ſee if they do not apply this to the Inward Call of the Spirit and Grace of Chriſt, to let him into our Hearts; and would one think that thoſe that wrote theſe things ſhould be againſt the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Diſpenſation of things? They ſay that this knocking at the Door of the Heart ſignifies the Call of God's Spirit at the Door of the Heart:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42790:46"/> There are two ſorts of Sinners that God knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the Door of their Hearts: one is a Man that is weary of his Sin; for his part, he wiſheth that he might never ſin more: As ſoon as he perceives the Knock, and is called upon to let in the Grace of God, to help him againſt Temptation, he freely opens his Heart to receive it, and ſaith; With all my Heart, I will entertain and welcome the Grace of God; glad I am that God hath had ſo much Patience towards me, and ſince God offers his Grace I will embrace this Grace of God above all Pleaſures, and I will take it into my Heart; the Grace of Chriſt is the greateſt Jewel that I know. Honeſt <hi>Paul,</hi> he took this Courſe, and prayeth, Lord take away this Tempter; here is a Temptation that troubleth me, and I am not willing to yield, for all the Devil follows me with it; He <hi>cried unto the Lord, and beſought him three times, earneſtly,</hi> to take away the Temptation: And the Lord anſwers him, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> What matter if the Tempter buffet thee, and the Temptation trouble thee, haſt thou not received my Grace into thy Heart? thou art a Believer and thy Truſt is in me, and <hi>my Grace is ſufficient for thee:</hi> Let the Tempter do his worſt, keep thou to the Grace of God, and thou wilt withſtand and overcome the Temptation when it comes.</p>
            <p>If a Man openeth his Heart and receiveth Chriſt when he comes, then you ſhall find ſuch an Alteration in that Man, that go and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42790:46"/> carry him the ſame Temptation which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over him the laſt Week, it will not do with him now; tho' he be as weak as Water, and as prone to Corruption and Iniquity as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet now having a Faith begotten in him, that the grace of God will defend him, he keeps out of the Devils Snares. Now this Man truſting in this grace till his Sin and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity be purged out; now is the time to ſpread the Table; there is a clean Heart, and the Heavenly Gueſts are now come, and the Dainties of the Kingdom are brought to him for his Nouriſhment. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I I will come in and ſup with him, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo will come, and we will ſup with him, and he with us.</hi> This never happens to any Body ſo long as the Table and Heart is foul; for the Table muſt be clean, and the Devil and Sin thrown out, and then will the Lord confirm and ratify and ſeal the Covenant; ſo that here is a Seal with a Witneſs. When a Man hath this Teſtimony of the Love of God that God is reconciled to him in Chriſt, then Chriſt will come in, and he will bring his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they will ſup with him; and this is that which will give compleat ſatisfaction to ſuch a Soul.</p>
            <p>All the Tongues of Men and Angels are too ſhort to ſpeak of theſe things, as they are in themſelves, but they are all manifeſted by the Spirit. All the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, are manifeſted by the Spirit of God; now to ſay there is no Spirit to be regarded
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42790:47"/> now adays, that is as much as to ſay, we muſt never regard the Kingdom of God, <hi>for no Man can diſcern the things of God but the Spirit of God,</hi> no Man can tell what they be; <hi>As no Man can know the things of a Man bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But I muſt look to this and the other Form and Mark and Method about them, for we can know nothing of the things of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>I hope you are all of another Judgment, and believe that this is a Trick and Cheat of the wicked one; People do find the Spirit and will feel it, if they will wait upon the Motions of it.

            <p>Here is <hi>Grace and Truth comes by Jeſus Chriſt, and God hath offered it to all Men, in that he hath raiſed up Chriſt from the Dead; the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation, hath appeared unto all Men;</hi> but all Men have not received it, therefore all Men have it not; and they that have not the Grace of Chriſt

            <p>Now for People to fall out, and ſay, my way is beſt, and thy way is not beſt, and to fall into Conteſts about many ways, when the Scripture concludes but one Way, is not well; We were better all agree about this Doctrin, That there is no poſſibility of Reconciliation with God ſince we are fallen out with him, and ſince Sin hath made a ſeparation, there is no way of being reconciled again to God but by and through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, nor by him neither unleſs we receive of his Spirit to quicken us; nothing can quicken us, enliven us or recommend us to God but the Spirit of Chriſt operating and working in our Hearts, that he may prepare us for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Kingdom.</p>
            <p>If People would agree upon this, there would be an end of all Labour, and Toyl, and Jangling about the right way, for the Conſequence and Concluſion would be thus;

            <p>If we be juſtified, we are not juſtified for a righteous, holy Life, and for our Obedience; but we are juſtified through Chriſt who worketh a godly Life in them that believe, ſo that a Man is not juſtified by any other way or means; and all other ways a Man takes of being reconciled to God are vain and fruitleſs, and have been ſpoken againſt by all that were moved by the Holy Ghoſt in the New Teſtament. Saith the Prophet, <hi>What ſhall I come before the Lord with all?</hi> I am fallen under Death and Sin and in a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, I would fain be reconciled to him; what ſhall I do to be reconciled to God?

No, never in this World, you muſt never come to Holineſs; do the beſt thou canſt do here, it is but Sin; the beſt days work thou makeſt is but Sin; the beſt Child of God on Earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live a Day without Sin: Do you hold out that in your way?

            <p>So that there hath been in all Ages a way of the working of the Spirit of God in the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42790:60"/> Hearts of them that believe, to prepare them for the ſinleſs Kingdom, for that glorious Kingdom; into which nothing that hurteth, and defileth, and corrupteth, can enter. And becauſe we cannot enter with Corruption and Defilement, he hath appointed the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Spirit to work out that which might hinder to cleanſe us from Sin, that we might <hi>have an abundant entrance into his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Kingdom;</hi> ſo that whilſt they ſay there is an impoſſibility of living without Sin, I had as leave they had ſaid, there is an Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of entring into the Kingdom of God; for never any ſhall come into the Kingdom of God but thoſe that are without Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> for there is no Purgatory after Death.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts have a better conceit than the Proteſtants in that reſpect: The Proteſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The Papiſts ſay none can come to Heaven till they be purged from Sin; and they ſay God hath appointed a place for that purpoſe, and Perſons muſt go into Purgatory,

            </p>
            <p>This is ſound Doctrin: I had rather truſt the Doctrin of the Prophets and Apoſtles than the Doctrin of them all, either Proteſtants or Papiſts; and had rather depend upon their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin for Salvation, that were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, than upon thoſe Doctors that ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:42790:61"/> There is no Inſpiration now-a-days. Some conceive this Scripture may be interpreted thus and thus; and others conceive it means ſo and ſo, but we muſt (ſay they) ſubmit to better Judgment: I am a fallible Man, I ſubmit it to better Judgments. Now when People are concerned for Immortality and Eternity, to have ſuch things diſhed out in ſuch a manner, what Souls are ſo dull but they would beſtir themſelves, and conſider and look about them before they go hence, how it ſhall go with them when they are gone?</p>
            <p>We are now to work out our own S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:42790:61"/>
            <p>We know when our Friends are in Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as in <hi>Turkey</hi> or elſwhere, we pay down our Mony for their Redemption; but we will not pay our Mony if they be kept in their Fetters ſtill.

               </gap>lled a redeemed Captive, but he muſt wear his Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtill? How long? as long as he hath a day to live.</p>
            <p>This is for Bodies; but now I am ſpeaking of Souls, Chriſt muſt be made to me Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and reſcue me from Captivity. Am I a Priſoner any where? Yes: <hi>Verily, verily, he that committeth ſin,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he is a ſervant of ſin,</hi> he is a Slave to Sin: If thou haſt ſinned thou art a Slave. A Captive that muſt be redeemed out of Captivity, who will pay a price for me? I am poor, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I cannot redeem my ſelf, who will pay a Price for me? There is one come that hath paid a Price for me: That is well, that is good News, then I hope I ſhall come out of my Captivity. What is his Name, is he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Redeemer? So then I do expect the Benefit of my Redemption, and that I ſhall go out of my Captivity. No, ſay they, you muſt abide in Sin, as long as you live: What benefit then have I by my Redemption? I could have been in Captivity no longer, if I had not been redeemed I muſt wear my Shackles and Fetters ſtill, and be ſubject to my old
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42790:62"/> Maſter and Patron, and when he will have me be drunk, I muſt be drunk; and when he will have me be unclean, I muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</p>
            <p>Thus many profeſt Chriſtians there be, (you ſee it with your Eyes) that will tell you they believe all the Articles of the Creed, and they have been baptized into the Chriſtian Faith, and can rehearſe all the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and perform the Duty of Chriſtians in going to Church, ſaying their Prayers, and in giving Alms too it may be; they are ſuch as would be called Chriſtians, they would be called ſo, yet they <hi>are not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from their vain Converſations;</hi> for what makes their Shackles and Fetters about them? When their old Maſter bids them be Drunk, they will be Drunk; and when he bids them commit Whoredom, or Lie, or Cheat their Neighbour, they will do it: You do believe the Devil leads you to this; you will not ſay the Spirit of God led you to it. If one demand, How did you do it? You ſay, the Devil prevailed upon me: What, hath the Devil Power over Men after they are Redeemed? What ſort of Redemption is this? Then comes in the old Shift again, we are Redeemed from the Puniſhment of our Sin, but not from the Act of it.</p>
            <p>Now if thoſe that are called Ranters had told me this Tale, it had been like them; but when Doctors of Divinity tell us this Tale, it is ſo unlike Divinity, that it is <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42790:62"/> Senſual and Deviliſh.</hi> To tell Believers they are redeemed from the Puniſhment of Sin, but not from the Act of Sin; that this is the benefit which we receive from Chriſt's Sufferings; that we may ſin on free Coſt; that there is no Guilt contracted by it; will any Man or Woman, that underſtands they have a Soul, venture their Immortal Souls on this Divinity? I hope not. They will not venture their Soul on this Foundation-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin: I hope God will awaken the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of People, that they will not hazard their Souls upon ſuch a carnal, devilliſh Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; that if the Devil ſhould preach, he could not preach a worſe Doctrin than this, to perſuade Chriſtians they may live in Sin, and Sin will not hurt them, nor impair or break their Peace with God and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him.</p>
            <p>I will tell you how it hath been with me; in my Childhood, if I had ſpoken a vain Word, or a falſe Word, I had contracted ſuch a Guilt thereby, that I was aſhamed to draw near to God, to pray to him; I knew he would not hear Liars, I knew there was no way to be accepted without Repentance and Amendment of Life. I believe others have met with the ſame dealing from God, by the ſecret Strokes of Conviction that have come upon their Hearts, when they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt God.</p>
            <p>So that I am ſtill of the Mind, that the Perſons that depend upon this kind of Doctrin
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42790:63"/> do at ſome times, eſpecially when Sickneſs comes, and Death looks them in the Face, or in times of common Contagion or Peſtilence, at ſuch a time they have a weight of Guilt upon their Conſciences; for this Doctrin will not ſupport them at Death, but that then they believe they have contracted Guilt, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Sin.</p>
            <p>I have wiſhed many times that the Lord would open the Eyes and Hearts of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this City and of this Nation, to ſee how miſerably they have ventured their Souls. Will Merchants in this City ever venture their Goods at ſuch a Rate as Men commonly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their Souls? What, will they venture their Goods in a Ship without a bottom, before ſhe goes to Sea? Now this Doctrin hath not a Foundation; ſhall I believe a Perſon that tells me I do not contract Guilt, when I feel it upon my Heart; when I commit Whoredom and Drunkenneſs, and Cheat my Neighbours, ſhall any one perſuade me that I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Guilt?</p>
            <p>O Friends, we are ſpeaking of great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; it is about Eternity, that we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is about the hazard of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; therefore, I pray, let every one be ſerious, and conſider what I ſay, for I ſpeak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore, it is needful for every one of you in every ſtate and condition that the Lord hath brought you into, to keep your ſelves in a deep Humility; to know the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, Temptations and Trials you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to exerciſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42790:75"/> Apoſtacy in her Nature, ſhe looked back, and was turned into a Pillar of Salt.

            <p>If we remember where our Safety is, and from whoſe Hands we muſt expect it, we need not go and look at <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife. We have ſeen many in our Days that have ſtood fair for Redemption, they have had a Power revealed to them, that is able to redeem them, and ſave them to the uttermoſt; but afterward by exalting themſelves above this Power, and taking the Government of themſelves into their own Hands, they have robbed God of his Glory, and he hath withdrawn himſelf from them, and then it was with them as with <hi>Saul,</hi> when the Lord departed from him, <hi>The evil Spirit entred into him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have before our Eyes from day to day, thoſe that have known the beginning of the Redemption of Gods Power, and have been in a great meaſure brought out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and out of the way of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they have had opened to them <hi>the Myſtery of the Kingdom of God</hi> for their Encouragement, but at laſt they have taken and arrogated theſe Gifts to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and looked upon themſelves as far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling others, magnifying their Parts as if
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42790:75"/> they were their own, when they were the gifts of God. Then the Lord hath left them to let them ſee whether they could ſtand of themſelves, and they have fallen, and been taken in the Ginns and Snares of the Devil, who <hi>like a roaring Lion goes about continually ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi>

            <p>Now, my Friends, it greatly concerns us all to know what Refuge we have to fly to in a time of Tryal; we have a time of Trial now, tho' not a time of External Suffering and Perſecution, and enduring Hardſhip yet upon us, to try our Faith and Truſt in God; yet we have no reaſon to be ſecure, careleſs nor remiſs in our preſent Duty, <hi>nor to put the evil day far from us,</hi> but to be in the exerciſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If any one in the time of Perſecution and Suffering hath ſaid within himſelf, I had better give over and part with the Truth, and forſake the ways of the Lord, and give over my Teſtimony for his Name, for I ſhall be undone and ruined in the World; this Man by his carnal Fears hath loſt his Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe if a Man in this time of liberty and freedom of ſerving the Lord, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teſtimony to his Name, if he ſhall not intirely truſt in the Lord, to carry him on in his Work and Service, and continue his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him, and wait for the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

               <salute>My Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere is no Man can truly worſhip God till he comes to a meaſure of certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him; for all the Worſhip in the World where the Vail of Ignorance ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails upon the Mind, is all abominable; there is no acceptance with God: There muſt be a knowledge of God before there can be a true Worſhipping of him; for they that worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they know God, <hi>they worſhip they know not what;</hi> they worſhip a God they have heard of, but do not know; ſo every one that would be a true Worſhipper muſt firſt come to that which giveth a true knowledge, that raiſeth up a certainty in the Mind, <hi>This is the Lord, we will truſt in him; this is our God, and we will ſerve him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that all People might come to this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Knowledge, therefore it is that <hi>God hath ſent forth his Spirit,</hi> that the things of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42790:77"/> God might be communicated by the Spirit of God, for without the Aſſiſtance of this Spirit Men ſeek after the Knowledge of God in vain; If they ſeek after the Knowledge of God, they cannot find it, and if they ſeek after the Worſhip of God, and after Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, they cannot find it; ſo that all Religion and religious Performances that People are exerciſed in, where the Spirit of Truth hath not the beginning they will all prove fruitleſs in the end.</p>
            <p>There be wiſe Men in the world, and they have imployed their wiſdom to find out the true God; but God in wiſdom hath ordained, that the world by all their wiſdom ſhall not know him; ſo there is an end of all their Labour: How ſhall they know him then? As <hi>none can know the things of a man ſave the ſpirit of a man that is in him, ſo none can know the things of God but the ſpirit of God;</hi> ſo that they that reſiſt the Guidance, Direction and Counſel of the Spirit of God, are like unto thoſe that would enter into a Houſe or Pallace, and remember not the Door that leads into it.</p>
            <p>People would fain come into the Divine Knowledge and into the underſtanding of Divine Myſteries, but they would come by it another way; they would ſtudy for it, they would learn it by Arts and Sciences, they would attain it by their own Induſtry; and herein they labour to excel one another. If there comes a Man among them that tell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:42790:78"/> them, Friends, you are all out of the way, then they are angry, and inſtead of enquiring what is the way, they are angry that their way muſt be rejected. Friends, you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to the Knowledge of God but by the Spirit of God; then they mock, and then they ſcoff and ſcorn the Doctrin of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for the Teaching of the Spirit hath been the common Scorn and Deriſion of our Age.</p>
            <p>It is ſo in our Day with many; if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to the Knowledge of God any other way but by the Spirit, they would deny to make uſe of that, to be ſubject to that, and theſe put their Truſt in their own Power and Induſtry, to find out the Myſtery of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; <hi>ſo they are ever learning, but are never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth: How ſhould they?</hi> How can a People come to the Knowledge of the Truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>ſpirit of truth that reveals it?</hi> Can any come to the Knowledge of Chriſt unleſs <hi>he that ſent him reveals him?</hi> Where are People's Books? where are their Bibles? where is their Rule (they call it ſo) that all their Endeavours for many Ages have proved fruitleſs in reſpect of the Knowledge of God?</p>
            <p>This is but your ſay ſo (may ſome ſay;) How doth it appear that we have not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the true Knowledge of God and to the true Worſhip, and to the true Religion?</p>
            <pb n="157" facs="tcp:42790:78"/>
            <p>I will tell you how it appears, for all in all Ages that have attained to the Knowledge of God, they have been <hi>made partakers of his divine nature</hi> and his Divine Qualities; they have brought forth a ſort of Fruit in their Lives and Converſations, that hath been of the ſame Nature, it hath been Holy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: They have known the Sanctifier, and they have been a ſanctified People, ſo they have become one with him, and have ſhewn forth the Beauty of Holineſs in their Lives, that is a Demonſtration that may ſhew the Knowledge of God, for without it they live another Life, an unholy one, a corrupt one, a Life of Self-love, a Life of Pride, Vanity and Enmity, and that they never had from God, but from another Root; a Life of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Sin, it came from another Seed; ſo that they are ſtill without the Knowledge of God,</p>
            <p>And again, all that have come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, they have truſted in him; that People cannot do now-a-days, except here and there a few that do know him; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Age they cannot truſt God; they muſt have ſomething elſe to rely upon, and truſt to, for in him they cannot truſt.

               </gap>es, one truſteth to one thing and another to another, but they would truſt in the Living God, and he ſhould be their God and their Rock, and they would venture their Concerns upon him both in this World, and that which is to come, if they did but know him. People may talk as much as they will, but he can never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be my God and thy God, till we caſt our care upon him, and can venture our concerns upon him both in this World and that which is to come, and can ſay, He is our God and our Relyance and Dependance is upon him.</p>
            <p>Now this is the Effect and Conſequence of this Knowledge of God; ſuch as come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, they ſhall not need to be bid to worſhip him: You ſhall not need to make a Law that this People ſhall worſhip the God that they know; there needs no Law to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the People of God to worſhip him; his <hi>law is written in their hearts,</hi> and they that know him will worſhip him. There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Man on Earth that had the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true and living God, that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be put upon worſhipping him, that needed a Law to oblige him to it; for the very Knowledge that is given of God through Chriſt, this brings forth naturally an Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inviſible Power which Men put
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42790:79"/> their Truſt in; it produceth an Adoration that is true Worſhip; it cauſeth an humble Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of that Power; it brings the Soul upon its Knees, as it were; it brings the Soul to ſtoop and bend, and bow upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to God, as his God: It raiſeth his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations to receive Counſel, and Judgment, and Underſtanding from him, as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Wiſdom; and hereby People are taught to worſhip in the right Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>But to tell Men of the Worſhip of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they know him; though you make as many Laws as you will to force them to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that God they do not know, yet you can never do them any good, nor make their Worſhip acceptable, nor make them devout; you can never bring Devotion nor Divine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration into their Hearts by all the Laws that you can make.</p>
            <p>But there is a Spirit of Life that ſets the Soul at liberty from its former Bondage to Sin and Satan; and when this Law comes to be revealed in my Heart, what ſaith this Law? Worſhip God, give Honour and Glory to him. This Law ſaith, Submit thy ſelf to him that redeemed thee, thou art his, thou art no more thine own: This Law being written in the Heart obligeth a Man to a true Worſhip, and to <hi>worſhip God in ſpirit and truth,</hi> for this Man hath done imagining among the Heathen, that there <hi>are Gods many and Lords many:</hi> He hath done imagining what God is and where

What, will this prove the light within? becauſe we have got a new Teſtament, and Chriſt hath ſpoken a great many gracious Words, and they are written down and recorded, doth this prove the light within? No, People might have been in darkneſs ſtill for all the Books of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42790:82"/> the New Teſtament, and the Old Teſtament to; and for all the Books in the World; for they would never have conveyed light into the Hearts and Conſciences of Men if God had not placed it there.</p>
            <p>Indeed theſe Books may be inſtrumental, and God doth make uſe of them as a means for the conveying of Light and Grace, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of true converſion; but the holy Scriptures cannot do it of themſelves, unleſs there be a coacting and cooperation of the Spirit of Chriſt with them; without this Spirit they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not convey ſaving Light to us: How prove you then a Light within? the Apoſtle tells you if you will believe him, 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>God who commandeth the Light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined into our Hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſo that every one that retireth into himſelf will know quickly and underſtand his Error, and confeſs that there is a Light within, and that by this rule becauſe there is ſomething in the Heart, that makes manifeſt that which is reprovable; if they do or ſay a thing reprovable, that which manifeſteth a thing is Light; that which manifeſteth dark words or works is Light.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42790:83"/> ſlightly and meanly of it, becauſe it hath done them no good inward nor outward that they know of: How ſhould it do you good when it hath done them none?

            </head>
            <p>IT is a general Doctrine in the World, That no man by any means in the World can ever be ſet free from Sin in this Life: This is univerſally received almoſt among all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in all Churches, one and another; tho' they differ never ſo much in other things, yet they agree in this; ſo that this Doctrine hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now while a Man is of that Belief, That there is an impoſſibility of living without Sin, and of breaking down the Kingdom of Satan in any one Soul in the World, How can Men hope or believe that Righteouſneſs ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the Heart of one Man?

And it is ſtill greater madneſs to ſay, That Chriſt and the Devil are both my Governours and Rulers: It is prodigious Folly and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſpeak after this manner.</p>
            <p>This Belief prevails over all Men; over the Wiſe, and Mighty, and Noble, and Learned, that they can never be freed from the Power of Sin in this World, but that the Devil will lead them into Sin every Day; le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But, bleſſed be God, many have vomited it up already: If they would have placed this Doctrine upon Man's Natural Ability, I would have ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to it. I know there is none of us all have a natural Ability an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ALl People that would worſhip God and meet together for that purpoſe, they had need have a great Reverence upon their Minds, and a holy Fear upon their Spirits, that when they enter into the Houſe of the Lord, and draw nigh to the living God, they might not <hi>offer the Sacrifice of Fools,</hi> but may offer to God that which may be acceptable to him: For all Worſhip, and all Religion, and all Offerings and Oblations that ever were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God by any People, they have had a return upon the Offerers and Worſhippers, either of acceptance or rejection. Many you know have been rejected tho' they have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and many have been accepted of God, and their Offerings have been <hi>a ſweet ſmelling Savour in his Noſtrils;</hi> and, I hope, we are all of that Mind that we would be glad to have our Worſhip, and Service and Offerings to God accepted in his ſight, and that our preſent aſſembling together might be for the
<pb facs="tcp:42790:104"/> better, and that every one might have an An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer of Peace, and of acceptance in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms; but that can never be unleſs Men be qualified and prepared in their drawing nigh to God, and that in all our Offerings and Worſhip that we perform, our Hearts be prepared <hi>according to the Preparation of the Sanctuary,</hi> the Preparation of Gods Dwelling and holy Place.</p>
            <p>The Worſhippers muſt be holy; there muſt be the Fear of God and a reverence of the great God upon their Minds, before People can offer an acceptable Sacrifice unto him, as the holy Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that cometh to God must believe that he is;</hi> which ſignifies, that a Preparation ought to be in the Minds and Hearts of People that would draw nigh to God; or perform any Service or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God, they muſt have the knowledge of the God whom they worſhip, they muſt firſt <hi>know that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Here is a qualification for Worſhippers, for religious Perſons; as they expect when they meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to find the Lord in the midſt of them, they muſt be qualified accordingly, there muſt be an Awe upon their Minds.</p>
            <p>I am in the Preſence of God, I have an expectation from God, that he will open his abounding Treaſury, and miniſter ſome good unto me, or elſe to what purpoſe do People draw nigh to God? It is becauſe they would have ſomething of him; but they muſt come
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42790:105"/> in an humble petitioning frame; <hi>He giveth Grace to the Humble.</hi> It is the Lofty, the Proud, thoſe that exalt themſelves, the Fat and the Full that want nothing. <hi>Theſe,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>the Lord beholdeth afar off.</hi> A proud Man or Woman cannot draw nigh to God, the Lord looks upon them afar off; nor do they partake of thoſe divine and heavenly Comforts and Bleſſings, and Counſels and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions that the humble Mind hath the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of and will certainly enjoy, <hi>The humble God will teach, he will inſtruct the Meek in his Way;</hi> but what is this to the lofty Mind? What is this to one that is exalted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited and puffed up, and reckons himſelf full and wanting nothing, while he is ſwimming in the Streams of the Pleaſures of this World, and ſavours only the things of the Earth, the Pleaſures of a ſenſual Mind? Theſe Perſons are not hungry, and ſo they are not fed; they are not thirſty, and ſo they never obtain that which can ſatisfie the Soul. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt pronounced a Bleſſing upon them that hunger and thirſt; but that is nothing to them that are full and lack nothing.</p>
            <p>So my Friends, in this and all other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Aſſemblies, a great care ought to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one, that their coming together to wait upon the Lord may be in that reverence and fear, and that hope and expectation at the Hands of God, that they might be bettered by it, or elſe they all loſe their labour, as <hi>Cain</hi> did; he would be an Offerer, he offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,

            <p>You know the general Doctrin of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants is, That we have no acceptance with God but through Jeſus Chriſt; we have no way to pleaſe God, nor can do any thing that ſhall be liked of in his ſight, but only through one only Mediator. Now if ſo be I go to worſhip God, or perform any religious Duty without reſpect and reference to the ſenſe and participation of the vertue and power of that only Mediator, how can I be accepted? And it hath pleaſed God out of his infinite Love to Mankind, to ſend this great Mediator into the World, that every Man that comes into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> World is made a Participant of ſomething of the Life and Vertue of that Mediator. So you read <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>In him was Life, and the Life

               </gap> to Men whether they are good or no, both to good and bad, tho' Men are bad, as all Men are by Nature: So that tho' they are Children of Wrath and Heirs of Eternal Damnation, and in their natural State by reaſon of Sin, yet for all that this one Mediator, in whom this Light hath ſhined, he hath ſent forth that Light among the Sons and Daughters of Men, that is, the Light of Men, that enlightens every one. So there is an Offer made of ſomething that preſents it ſelf to the view of every Man that is good, if he apply his Mind to it, he may have that Good that comes by Jeſus Chriſt; he may draw nigh to God; as bad as he is, he hath ſome good that God hath beſtowed upon Men good and bad. There is no Man ſuch a Liar but he hath ſome Truth in him; there is no Man ſo ungodly, but he knows that which is pure and holy, that which hath reproved him, checked, convinced him of his Ungodlineſs. This preſents it ſelf to the view of every Man and Woman, and calls them to Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>

            <p>Many have come to a Meeting with looſe, prophane and wandring Minds, and though many good things have been ſpoken to them, it hath not reached ſo far as to beget good Deſires, their Hearts have been ſo alienated from the Grace of God in themſelves, which is the great ſuperiour Worker, to which we are but Servants and Miniſters; there is none can beget any thing but he in whom all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is.
